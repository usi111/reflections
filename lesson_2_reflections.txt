1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new (hidden) .git-folder is added to the directory. This indicates Git that it is a directory which should be tracked via git. 
-----------------

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can decide which files I would like to add to a commit and which ones not.

------------------
3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can only add those files/directories to the staging area which are logically connected and were I've made changes on it. This gives me full flexibility in adding only the desired files.

5) What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
