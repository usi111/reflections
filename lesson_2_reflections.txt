1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new (hidden) .git-folder is added to the directory. This indicates Git that it is a directory which should be tracked via git. 
-----------------

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can decide which files I would like to add to a commit and which ones not.
